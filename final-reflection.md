# Final Reflection
I would assign myself the grade of A for this class. I believe I have followed the expectations set for the course, and even though I was having some problems in the beginning of the term, I believe I was able to overcome those challenges and do a really good job.

L1: Design and Implementation of Data Structures
I believe I have shown a really good understanding of the design and implementation of data structures in the files that I posted in here. I believe that the implementation of data structures was our biggest focus this term, and I believe I have completely understood every single application and data structure. One special mention was the implementation of a hash function. I wrote a hash function that would get any initials and transform them into a number, showing that I understand it.

L2: Application of Basic Data Structures
As said above, I believe I have fully understood how to implement every single data structure present in our course. Some examples of this were on both individual exams, and on homework 4. 

L3: Reading and Writing Computationally
This was probably the most challenging aspect of this class. I believe I made really good progress on the skills of reading and writing computationally throughout this term. I completed the perusall readings in time and whenever I had a question I asked. Before starting classes I took some online courses in C++ to try to learn the syntax beforehand and I believe that helped a lot, especially when I needed to compile, execute, and do things in the terminal in general.

L4: Failure
I think this was the most common thing for me this term. I canâ€™t remember how many times I failed while trying to write/read code. I definitely felt stuck at various points while doing homework, but the perusall readings and some googling was usually enough to figure stuff out.

L5: Reflection and Metacognition
I believe I always made good use of the feedback given after every single assignment to fix the mistakes I had made. I really liked the structure implemented in this course of ungrading. For some reason I felt more inclined to actually learn the material instead of just submitting anything to get points. The fact that we could change the due dates also helped a lot! Sometimes I had too much for other classes and knowing that I could change the due date for this class definitely made things easier. I believe that overall I did a really good job in this class. However, one thing that I want to change for next year is having a better routine and not procrastinating too much.

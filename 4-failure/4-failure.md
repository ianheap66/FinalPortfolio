Failure. Take risks and push the boundaries of your understanding to the point where you are not always succeeding at a given problem. Stray out of your comfort zone and be able to evaluate your failures and your mistakes in a holistic way. Be able to reroute back-on-track when failure happens through a variety of means (troubleshooting, asking for help, taking a different approach, scaling back, scaling up).
